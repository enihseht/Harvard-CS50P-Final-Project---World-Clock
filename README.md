  # Audio World Clock

The World Clock Scraper is a Python program developed as part of the CS50 Introduction to Python Programming course. It serves the purpose of scraping real-time world clock information from a website, creating a dictionary that pairs city names with their respective times, and offering the choice of presenting the information in either text or audio format using text-to-speech.

    Web scraping: The program leverages the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and extracting world clock data.
    Data extraction: It parses the HTML content using lxml to fetch city names and their corresponding times.
    Dictionary creation: The program structures the retrieved data into a dictionary, with city names as keys and times as values.
    Command-line interface: Users can provide command-line arguments to specify the city and the desired output format.
    Text output: It presents city names and current times in text format, enhancing visual representation with ASCII art generated by the pyfiglet library.
    Audio output: With the assistance of the pyttsx3 library, the program can convert time information into speech for audio output.
    Error handling: The program includes error-handling mechanisms through the sys module to manage situations involving invalid city names and network connection errors.

Dependencies

The World Clock Scraper relies on the following Python libraries:

    BeautifulSoup4: Used for web scraping and parsing HTML content.
    pyfiglet: Utilized for creating ASCII art to visually represent city names and times.
    requests: Employed for making HTTP requests to retrieve website content.
    pyttsx3: Used for converting time information into speech for audio output.
    sys: Employed for error handling and program termination in the event of exceptions.

Usage

To use the World Clock Scraper, follow these steps:

    1. Install the required dependencies by executing pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
    2. Run the program with the command python main.py --sound --city [CITY] to obtain both audio and text output, or python main.py --city [CITY] to receive only text output.
    3. Replace [CITY] with the name of the desired city to retrieve its current time.
    4. The program will display the city name and time in text format. If the --sound flag is provided, it will also vocalize the time using text-to-speech.

Example

To retrieve the current time in New York with both audio and text output, execute the following command:

    python project.py --sound --city Bucharest
